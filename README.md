# Parsimonious

A parser combinator crate written in Rust.

## Purpose

Don't use this. It works well and is easy to use, but there are much more performant and Rusty parsers out there like [nom](https://docs.rs/nom/latest/nom/).

The purpose of this is to teach myself some of the more advanced features of Rust, like generics, traits, and the semantics of closures.
